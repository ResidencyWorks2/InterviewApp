# Managed Cloud Providers – Global Rule

**Scope**: Applies to every change in InterviewApp. No work may ship without passing these MCP gates.

## 1. Prime Directive
Always use the blessed MCP for its domain unless the Constitution/Context7 plan explicitly grants an override. Missing documentation = blocking defect; halt work and update the plan via Context7 before coding.

## 2. Provider Playbooks

### Context7 (Specs & Quality Gates)
- Pull the latest spec/plan/tasks from Context7 before writing code.
- Re-run required gates when a plan says to “STOP AND VALIDATE”.
- Any divergence from Context7 must be documented back into the active plan before implementation resumes.

### Supabase (Auth, Storage, Postgres)
- Regenerate `src/types/database.types.ts` whenever the schema changes via `pnpm run update-types` or `pnpm run update-types:remote`.
- Commit regenerated types in the same PR.
- Only access Supabase through the typed clients in `src/lib/supabase/{client,server,proxy}.ts`.
- Block merges if types are stale or client usage bypasses the typed helpers.

### PostHog (Product Analytics)
- All events must pass through `DataScrubber` (PII-safe payloads) before calling PostHog.
- `distinctId` must be anonymized; no emails or raw identifiers.
- Required events (e.g., `content_pack_missing`) must fire exactly where specs demand.
- Fail the build/review if analytics validation or scrubbing tests are missing.

### Sequential-Thinking Workflow
- When a plan marks “Sequential Strategy (Recommended/Required)”, finish phases in order: Setup → Foundational → Story 1 → Story 2 → …
- Do not parallelize tasks that the plan marks sequential without first updating the Context7 plan to reflect the change.
- Treat sequential checkpoints (e.g., “STOP and VALIDATE”) as blocking quality gates.

### Serena (Code Intelligence & Symbolic Editing)
- Serena provides semantic code analysis and symbolic editing tools for efficient codebase navigation and modification.
- **Project Management**: `activate_project`, `get_current_config`, `check_onboarding_performed`, `onboarding`
- **File Operations**: `list_dir`, `find_file`, `read_file` (via standard tools), `read_memory`, `list_memories`, `write_memory`, `edit_memory`, `delete_memory`
- **Symbol Discovery**: `get_symbols_overview`, `find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `search_for_pattern`
- **Symbolic Editing**: `replace_symbol_body`, `insert_after_symbol`, `insert_before_symbol`, `rename_symbol`
- **File Editing**: `replace_content` (regex/literal), `search_for_pattern`
- **Thinking Tools**: `think_about_collected_information`, `think_about_task_adherence`, `think_about_whether_you_are_done`
- **Workflow**: Prefer Serena's symbolic tools over reading entire files when exploring code. Use `get_symbols_overview` first, then read specific symbol bodies only when needed.
- Serena tools are token-efficient and should be prioritized for code navigation and editing tasks.

## 3. Compliance Checklist (run before every PR)
1. Context7 artifacts synced and gates passed.
2. Supabase types regenerated (if schema touched) and clients used.
3. PostHog events scrubbed + required telemetry covered by tests.
4. Task order respects the latest sequential instructions.
5. Serena tools used appropriately for code navigation and editing (prefer symbolic tools over full file reads).

Failure to satisfy any item blocks merge until resolved.
