## Checklist Templates

The `checklist_templates.sql` file seeds coaching tips for evaluation categories:

### Primary Categories
- **Clarity**: Tips for clear communication and articulation
- **Structure**: Tips for organizing and structuring responses
- **Content**: Tips for providing relevant, detailed content
- **Delivery**: Tips for confident delivery and pacing

### Alternative Categories (for category matching)
- **Communication**: Maps to Clarity via matching algorithm
- **Problem Solving**: Maps to Structure/Content via matching algorithm
- **Technical Accuracy**: Maps to Content via matching algorithm

The category matching algorithm (FR-016) handles case-insensitive matching and fuzzy matching for variations.

## Sample Users

The seed data includes 5 sample users with different profiles:

1. **John Doe** (PRO) - Software Engineer with multiple evaluations
2. **Jane Smith** (TRIAL) - Product Manager with UX design experience
3. **Mike Johnson** (FREE) - Data Scientist exploring DevOps
4. **Sarah Wilson** (PRO) - Senior Engineer with marketing interest
5. **Alex Brown** (TRIAL) - Data Analyst with product management goals

## Evaluation Categories

Comprehensive scoring categories include:
- Technical Accuracy
- Problem Solving
- Communication
- Code Quality
- System Design
- Time Management
- Creativity
- Business Acumen
- User Focus
- Data Analysis
- Leadership
- Adaptability

## Usage

To apply the seed data to your Supabase database:

```bash
# Reset and apply all migrations and seeds
supabase db reset

# Or apply seeds to existing database
supabase db seed
```

The seed files are configured in `supabase/config.toml`:
```toml
[db.seed]
enabled = true
sql_paths = [
  './seed.sql',
  './seeds/content_packs.sql',
  './seeds/sample_evaluations.sql',
  './seeds/checklist_templates.sql'
]
```

## Data Characteristics

- **Realistic Responses**: All evaluation responses are written as if by real candidates
- **Varied Difficulty**: Questions range from medium to hard difficulty
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Multiple evaluation criteria with weighted scores
- **Time-based Data**: Timestamps are relative to current time for dynamic testing
- **Status Variety**: Includes completed, processing, and failed evaluations
- **Progress Tracking**: User progress data shows realistic learning patterns
- **Idempotency**: All seed files use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to allow safe re-running

## Customization

You can modify the seed data by:
1. Editing the SQL files directly
2. Adding new content packs following the JSON schema
3. Creating additional sample users and evaluations
4. Adjusting scoring criteria and weights
5. Adding new checklist templates for additional categories

## Schema Compliance

All seed data follows the database schema defined in the migration files:
- Tables and columns match the current schema
- Foreign key relationships are respected
- Data types and constraints are validated
- RLS policies are considered (seed data may bypass RLS in some cases)

## Checklist Templates Location

**Where checklist items are set:**
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20251206010000_create_checklist_tables.sql` contains initial seed data (legacy categories)
- **Seed File**: `supabase/seeds/checklist_templates.sql` contains the primary seed data for actual evaluation categories
- **Best Practice**: Use the seed file (`checklist_templates.sql`) for adding new checklist items, as it's easier to maintain and follows Supabase seeding best practices

**To add new checklist items:**
1. Edit `supabase/seeds/checklist_templates.sql`
2. Add new INSERT statements with appropriate category, item_text, display_order, and is_active values
3. Run `supabase db seed` to apply changes

**To update existing items:**
1. Use UPDATE statements in a new migration or seed file
2. Or manually update via Supabase Dashboard or SQL editor
