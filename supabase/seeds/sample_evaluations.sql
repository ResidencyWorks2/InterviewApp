-- ADDITIONAL SAMPLE EVALUATION RESULTS
-- ==============================================

-- NOTE: Evaluation results seed data is commented out because the evaluation_results table
-- schema was changed in migration 20251121000000_fix_evaluation_results_schema.sql
-- to support the AI/ASR evaluation feature. The new schema requires:
-- - request_id (UUID PRIMARY KEY)
-- - job_id (TEXT NOT NULL)
-- - score, feedback, what_changed, practice_rule (all required)
-- - duration_ms (instead of duration_seconds)
--
-- The old seed data used columns that no longer exist:
-- - duration_seconds, word_count, wpm, categories, status
--
-- To seed evaluation results, use the AI/ASR evaluation API or create a new seed file
-- that matches the current schema.

  'For the system design question about a distributed cache, I would implement a consistent hashing approach with multiple cache nodes. Each node would be responsible for a range of hash values. For cache invalidation, I would use a write-through strategy where writes go to both cache and database, and implement a TTL-based expiration. To handle network partitions, I would use a quorum-based approach where a majority of nodes must agree on cache updates. For consistency, I would implement eventual consistency with conflict resolution based on timestamps.',

I would conduct contextual inquiries to observe users in their natural environment. For quantitative data, I would use surveys to gather broader insights. I would also analyze existing banking app reviews and conduct competitive analysis. The research would be segmented by user types: tech-savvy millennials, older adults, and small business owners.

For failure handling, I would implement automatic rollback on test failures and manual approval gates for production. The pipeline would use feature flags for gradual rollouts.

Challenges include infrastructure costs and data consistency during the switch.',

  'Random forests and gradient boosting are both ensemble methods but differ in key ways. Random forests use bagging with random feature selection, creating independent trees that vote on the final prediction. Gradient boosting uses boosting, where each tree corrects the errors of previous trees. Random forests are less prone to overfitting and faster to train, while gradient boosting often achieves higher accuracy but is more prone to overfitting. I would use random forests when interpretability and speed are important, and gradient boosting when maximum accuracy is the priority. For overfitting in deep learning, I would use: 1) Dropout layers, 2) L1/L2 regularization, 3) Early stopping, 4) Data augmentation, 5) Batch normalization, 6) Reducing model complexity.',
